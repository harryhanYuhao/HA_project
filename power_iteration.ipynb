    "\n",
    "The Power Iteration method is an iterative algorithm used to find the dominant eigenvector and eigenvalue of a square matrix. It is particularly useful when the matrix is large and sparse.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Choose a random non-zero vector $\\mathbf{v}_0$ as an initial approximation to the dominant eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iteration**:\n",
    "   - Repeat until convergence or a specified number of iterations:\n",

    "     - Update the approximation to the dominant eigenvector: $ \\mathbf{v}_{k+1} = \\frac{\\mathbf{w}}{||\\mathbf{w}||} $, where $||\\cdot||$ denotes the Euclidean norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Result**: After convergence, the final approximation $\\mathbf{v}$ will be the dominant eigenvector of $A$, and the corresponding eigenvalue can be computed as the Rayleigh quotient.\n",
